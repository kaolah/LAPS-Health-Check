Script LAPS Health Check will show you all details for all computers in your environment. 

Do you want to check if all computers have been enrolled with LAPS? 
Do they all have paswword? 
Do they all regularly change their password?

To get all these information you can use the script to create a scheduled task to get report and send it by mail. 

  - List of not enrolled computers
  - List of enrolled computers with stale password
  - List of enrolled computers with all users/groups who can read LAPS password
  - Create CSV report files
